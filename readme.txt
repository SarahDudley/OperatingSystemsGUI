This is an angular 2 project. Professor Price said it was okay for me to make my project in mostly javascript. In order to run, do the following:

node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x need to be installed in your machine before running this. Confirm with node -v on command line.

1. Make sure you're in the 'myProject' directory.
2. Open command line.
3. type the following into command line: npm install
4. type the following into command line: npm start
5. A web browser will open with the project gui.

I have attached a video which demonstrates my project just in case there are issues in running it.
