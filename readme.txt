This is an angular 2 project. My professor said it was okay for me to make my project in mostly TypeScript. In order to run, do the following:

node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x need to be installed in your machine before running this. Confirm with node -v on command line.

1. Make sure you're in correct directory.
2. Open command line.
3. type the following into command line: npm install
4. type the following into command line: npm start
5. A web browser will open with the project gui.
